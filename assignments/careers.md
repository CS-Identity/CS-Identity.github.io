Career Exploration Exercise
==========================

The goal of this exercise is to explore possible roles you would be interested in pursuing. You will identify the knowledge, skills, and abilities you already have for the role(s) and consider what you still need to learn.

Exercise specification:

1. **Find three job postings for roles that interest you.** You may use any job site you like, for example indeed.com, LinkedIn, Stack Overflow Jobs, or a desired company's careers page.

2. **Describe what interests you about each role.** 

3. **Describe the required qualifications you would be able to demonstrate now.**

4. **Describe the required qualifications you still need to acquire.**

5. **Describe at least one thing you could do to acquire one or more of the qualifications you would not be able to demonstrate now.**

Be prepared to share your thoughts with the group.
