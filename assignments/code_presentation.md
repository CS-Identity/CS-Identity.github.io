Code Presentation Exercise
==========================

The goal of this exercise is to give you practice explaining code and an opportunity to reflect on choices made and lessons learned during the development process.

It is not expected that you do a significant amount of preparation for this exercise, however you may want to spend a little bit of time choosing the code you will present and thinking through the prompts described below. 

There are two options for this exercise. Regardless of the option you choose, **make sure not to violate your instructors' academic integrity guidelines. Do not choose a project that has not been completed, and do not choose a project that another student may be assigned in the future.**

For both options, you will have a 20-minute slot during which to respond to the prompts described below and respond to questions. 

[Sign up for your slot here!](https://northeastern-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/s_rollins_northeastern_edu/ERscoQ2GlAhCnZWwzSWh_-EBOS5MxA9SKD6ykJanofIebA?e=wf1GxB) To select a slot from Column A enter your name in the corresponding cell from Column B. (The options for this kind of functionality are surprisingly limited in Office 365!)

# Option 1

Select a project that you developed. The project can be in any programming language, and it can be from a class or can be a program you developed for another purpose. Again, make sure you do not choose a project that another student may be assigned in the future. Be prepared to discuss the following:

1. **Describe a choice you made during development.** This could a small choice or a large choice. You could, for example, describe why you chose to use a ```for``` loop rather than a ```while``` loop. Or, you could describe how you chose a particular third-party framework or tool for use in your program. These are only examples.
2. **Describe a problem you encountered and how you solved it.** Again, your problem could be small, such as a missing ```;``` that took a long time to find, or large, for example you may have initially implemented an inefficient algorithm that resulted in an unreasonably long execution time.
3. **Reflect on something you learned during development of the program.** The lesson may be related to the problems you encountered, or could be anything else that you think will help you the next time you write a program.
4. **Identify something you would like to discuss or about which you would like to receive feedback.** You could, for example, ask the class to offer feedback about a design choice that you made. 

# Option 2

Select an open source project you find online. If you are unable to identity a project that you believe will not violate the academic integrity policies of your instructors you may, instead, choose any project you find online. Be prepared to discuss the following:

1. **Describe what the program does.** Provide an overview of the functionality of the program. If possible, consider running the program to demonstrate what it does.
2. **Describe the design of the project.** Discuss how the programmer(s) structured the code.
3. **Identify one positive element of the design or implementation.** Discuss one element of the design or implementation that you think is particularly good.
4. **Identify one question or negative design decision.** Identify an element of the design or implementation that is unclear or poorly designed. Lead discussion about how the element could be improved.
