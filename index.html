		<b>Course Description</b> 
	</p>

	<p>Some computer scientists learned to program in elementary school, and some earned a Ph.D. in another field before writing their first line of code. Some computer scientists spend their free time reading Hacker News, and some prefer to bake, or hike, or visit museums. Those who did not take a traditional path into computing may struggle to envision themselves as computer scientists. However, computer science is a broad, diverse field. No matter your background, your hobbies, or your working style, computer science has a place for you.</p>

 	<p><b>Seminar Topics:</b> This experience is designed for students who have taken a non-traditional path into computing. It will help students to develop their identity as computer scientists. Some of the questions weâ€™ll explore include the following: 
 		<ul>
			<li>What does the field of computing include? How do the subfields of computing fit together? </li>
			<li>Who are computing professionals? What are their roles, and what do they do in their work? </li>
			<li>How does one learn to speak the language of a computer scientist? </li>
			<li>How does one develop the skills to practice the computing profession? </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
 

	<p><b>Format and Activities:</b> This experience will be highly interactive. You will be expected to come to each session ready to ask questions, participate in discussion, and work on interactive exercises. There will not be right answers, so you will be expected to engage and explore. The seminar activities may include the following: 
		<ul>
			<li>Code reviews sessions where you will be expected to explain a program and describe how it could be improved.</li>
			<li>Design exercises where you will be expected to propose an idea for a programming project and describe it to the class </li>
			<li>Mentored laboratory exercises where you will work in teams to learn a new tool or technology  </li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p><b>Logistics: </b>

		<ul>
			<li>One two-hour meeting per week is required; minimal outside work will be expected. </li>
			<li>Up to 10 students may participate. </li>
			<li>The seminar will meet remotely via Zoom. Optional in-person meetings may be offered as health and safety precautions allow. </li>
			<li>The seminar will not be a formal class; it will not require payment or appear on your transcript. </li>
		</ul>
